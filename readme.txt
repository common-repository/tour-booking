Plugin for tour booking: a tourist can select a tour from the listing provided on the page

== Description ==

This plugin is designed for travel agencies, private guides and other companies that provide the opportunity to book a tour for their customers - hotels and other booking companies.

Each tour is a post that has the following properties:
- name
- annotation
- description
- initial picture
- tour duration in hours
- cost
- transport type (pedestrian, automobile/car, ship/boat, bycicle, etc.)
- city
- starting point
- finish point
- order (number; the smaller it is, the closer the tour is to the top of the list; by default, tours are arranged by date of creation)

Also a tour, like other Wordpress posts, can have a category and tags.

The plugin has a filter (widget) that allows you to select tours by city, transport, tag and category. It has also an automatic shortcode generator that allows you to place on the page tours selected by these parameters.

== Installation ==
 
1. Upload `tour-booking.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
